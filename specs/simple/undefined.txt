notes: """
  It's possible for `undefined` to be redefined in JavaScript, eg, `var
  undefined = 2`. While this is undesirable and never recommended, Js2coffee
  ensures that using `undefined` will use whatever `undefined` is defined as.

  The backticks around it ensures that CoffeeScript will not compile
  `undefined` into `void 0`.
